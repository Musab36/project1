        <p class="story">Kirk Kerkorian was growing up during the height of the Great Depression. He had to drop out of school in order to find ways to earn money to help the family. He became a boxer, thus allowing him to bring home some extra cash. He then joined the
          Royal Air Force where he became a daredevil pilot, flying over routes in the Atlantic that had a 25 percent casualty rate. From there, he took his chance in craps before finally earning enough money to become a real estate magnate in Las Vegas.
          He purchased The Flamingo, before building The International and MGM Grand.</p>

        <p class="story">Maria Das Gracas Silva Foster grew up in the Brazilian town of Morro de Adeus. The town was known to be an extremely poor neighborhood. It only got worse as it eventually became a shantytown. To make matters worse, Foster’s father was an alcoholic.
          It was her mother who was supporting the family, but most of the time, it was not enough. Thus, Foster was forced to go out and try to earn additional money by collecting used cans and papers and selling them to junk buyers. But Foster persisted
          and eventually became an intern in Petrobras in 1978. Her hard work soon paid off and she became the head of the company’s field engineering department. In early 2012, Foster became the CEO of the company, becoming the first female to head Petrobras.</p>
