        <p class="story">A vintage Rolex wristwatch sold at Phillips in Geneva for $5,060,427, becoming the most expensive Rolex ever auctioned. The watch, a 1952 reference 6062 called the "Bao Dai," led a record-high watch sale by Phillips on May 13 and 14 that totaled
          $32.6 million, the highest result ever in the history of watch auctions. The Bao Dai is named after its former owner, the last emperor of Vietnam, who purchased the timepiece in Geneva during peace negotiations in 1954.</p>

        <p class="story">A pair of fancy colored diamond earrings sold for a whopping $57.4 million at auction Tuesday, setting a new record. The pear-shaped earrings were being auctioned separately by Sotheby's, however, they were sold to a single, anonymous buyer. The
          buyer snatched up "The Apollo Blue" earring for $42.1 million, and "The Artemis Pink" diamond for $15.3 million. Combined, the pair set a record for the most expensive earrings ever sold at auction. The prior record was held by the Miroir de
          l'Amour earrings sold by Christie's last year for $17.6 million. The Apollo stone is a 14.54-carat blue diamond, while the nearly identical Artemis stone is a 16-carat pink diamond. The auction house had estimated that the pink diamond would
          sell for between $12.5 million and $18 million, while the blue stone would go for between $38 million and $50 million. Sotheby's said demand for colored diamonds remains strong. This spring the auction house broke the world record for the most
          expensive diamond ever sold at auction with the $71.2 million sale of the "Pink Star" diamond. "In the last five to 10 years, the price seems to be escalating rapidly. And we just sold this world record stone, and that was a pink diamond," said
          David Bennett, worldwide chairman of Sotheby's International Jewellery division, ahead of the auction. "Certainly people who own important colored diamonds are aware that the market is strong."</p>
